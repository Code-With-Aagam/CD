# C-compiler

a extremely simple compile, or maybe I should call it an interpreter.

I was inspired by the famous 'C4' repository, which build a C-compiler with only 4 function. I found a tutorial on the internet and followed it, it's really interesting.

the recursive part is ... grabbed from internet, it's really hard, I still can't comprehend it. also the vm part I grabbed a lot.

I'm trying to add more features based on it.

--------------

about the compiler:

it only support basic type like int or char.

not all operators are supported, I choose some of them which looks easy.

not all escaped characters are supported, only '\n'.

for comments, it only support //.

no macro supported.

no complicate struct supported, like 'struct', 'union'
